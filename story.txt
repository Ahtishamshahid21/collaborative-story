A Short Story

In the heart of an ancient forest, a small fox named Liora discovered a silver key beneath a moss-covered stone.
She carried it in her mouth, unsure why it felt so important, but certain it held meaning.
By moonlight, the key shimmered and pulsed with warmth, guiding her steps through twisted roots and silent trees.
She reached a forgotten clearing where a crooked oak stood, its trunk marked with a tiny keyhole.
With a trembling paw, she placed the key inside, and the oak creaked open like a door.
Inside, stars hung low, and the ground shimmered like a mirrorâ€”she had entered a realm of dreams.
Creatures made of starlight welcomed her, whispering of a prophecy long untold.
Liora, they said, was chosen to heal the fading bond between worlds.
Given a cloak of woven moonbeams, she soared over lands that once knew magic.
